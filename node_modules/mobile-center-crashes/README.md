# Mobile Center SDK for React Native
## Mobile Center Crashes Module

Mobile Center is mission control for mobile apps. Get faster release cycles, higher-quality apps, and the insights to build what users want.

Mobile Center Crashes will automatically generate a crash log every time your app crashes. The log is first written to the device's storage and when the user starts the app again, the crash report will be sent to Mobile Center. Collecting crashes works for both beta and live apps, i.e. those submitted to the App Store. Crash logs contain valuable information for you to help fix the crash.
